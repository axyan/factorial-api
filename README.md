# Factorial API

A simple factorial API that calculates the factorial using either a single or
multiple threads. This was created to get practice with using worker_threads
to manage the workload of CPU intensive tasks.

Benchmarking factorials of small numbers reveal no significant differences in
compute time, up to a certain point. Single threading actually outperforms
multithreading at small factorials which is likely due to the overhead in
setting up worker threads. This overhead becomes negligable as factorial numbers
increase. For example, factorial of 100,000 shows multithreading completing its
computation about 2 seconds earlier than single threading. Factorial of 500,000
shows multithreading completing its computation about 1 minute earlier than
single threading.

Simple tests to ensure factorials are calculated correctly.
